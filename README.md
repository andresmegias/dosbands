# Electronic Density of States and Energy Bands Plotter 

The script `dosbandsplot.py`, written in Python 3, can represent electronic bands and densities of states calculated by the software Quantum ESPRESSO. The script needs the libraries NumPy and Matplotlib.

You can read the user guide ([`userguide.pdf`](https://github.com/andresmegias/qe-dosbandsplot/blob/main/userguide.pdf)) to learn how to use this script, and you can try the example using the data and the configuration file contained in the `example` folder.
